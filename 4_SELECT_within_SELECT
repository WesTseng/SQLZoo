SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population >
(SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name='Russia');

--2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
SELECT name FROM world 
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
AND gdp/population >

ORDER BY name

--4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE population >
(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Canada')
AND
population <

WHERE a.area = (SELECT MAX(b.area) FROM world AS b
WHERE a.continent = b.continent);

--8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
SELECT  a.continent, a.name FROM world a
WHERE a.name <= ALL(SELECT b.name FROM world b 
WHERE a.continent = b.continent)
ORDER BY continent;

--9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. 
--Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
SELECT a.name, a.continent, a.population FROM world a
WHERE 25000000 > 
ALL(SELECT b.population FROM world b 
WHERE a.continent = b.continent);

--10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). 
--Give the countries and continents.

WHERE a.population/3 >
ALL(SELECT b.population FROM world b
WHERE a.continent = b.continent
AND a.name != b.name);
